**Concepto**  
Un sistema de aprendizaje efectivo conecta tres bucles: codificación profunda,
repetición espaciada y hábitos consistentes. Cada pieza alimenta a la otra para
convertir información en decisiones reales.

**Componentes**  
- [[Encoding]]: reduce la fuga inicial y establece significado desde el minuto
  cero.  
- [[Spaced Repetition (SR)]] y [[Flashcards]]: mantienen viva la memoria con
  recordatorios diseñados por ti.  
- [[Habits of Highly Effective Students Study for Success]]: protegen bloques de estudio, enseñan y convierten la dificultad en rutina.  
- [[Note Taking System]]: captura ideas en papel y las migra al segundo cerebro.  
- [[How to read a book?]] + [[How to remember what you read?]]: definen cómo
  consumir, digerir y revisar fuentes largas.

**Flujo sugerido**  
1. Define qué proyecto o pregunta estás respondiendo.  
2. Consume con intención y etiqueta ideas usando PACER.  
3. Codifica creando notas permanentes, demostraciones o enseñando.  
4. Genera tarjetas/manuales solo para lo que necesitas recordar.  
5. Agenda repeticiones y sesiones de aplicación práctica.  
6. Cierra el ciclo con una retro breve: ¿qué funcionó? ¿qué hábito ajustarás?

What is encoding in the context of learning?::A cognitive process where information is connected into our brain, transforming sensory information from working memory into long-term memory
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,249-->

According to the multi-store model, what is the path information takes to reach long-term memory?::Sensory memory → Working memory (short-term) → Encoded into long-term memory
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,206-->

What is the relationship between encoding and retrieval? ? They are two sides of the same coin - you cannot retrieve what you don't encode effectively (you can't pour from an empty or leaky bucket)

What happens to the forgetting curve when encoding is done effectively? ? The forgetting curve starts flatter to begin with, significantly reducing the need for frequent revisions and allowing retention for much longer periods

What is desirable difficulty in encoding? ? The discomfort and difficulty associated with effective encoding that requires significant cognitive load - high cognitive load feels confusing and involves actively trying to figure things out

Why does Dr. Justin Sung argue that encoding is more crucial than active recall and spaced repetition? ? Because effective encoding reduces the need for constant repetition, saving significant study time, while retrieval techniques have rapidly diminishing returns and are inherently repetitive

What brain regions are activated during manual flashcard creation?::Dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, enhancing encoding through generative processing
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,214-->

==Flashcards== facilitate active recall, forcing the brain to make an effort to retrieve information, which significantly ==strengthens neural connections== and combats the Forgetting Curve.
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,236!2025-10-01,1,229-->

What are the two main implementation methods for flashcards?
?
1) Classic Approach (Leitner System/Box Method)
2) Modern Digital Implementations with automated review schedules
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,206-->

What percentage of students' exam performance improvement is shown when using spaced repetition versus cramming?::70% vs 64% (University of Leicester 2020 study)
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210-->

What are the seven steps of effective book reading?
?
1. Define a Reading Objective
2. Pre-reading Phase
3. Reading Comprehension Phase
4. Analytical Reading Phase
5. Effective Note-taking Phase
6. Reading Retention Phase
7. Practice and Adapt Techniques
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210-->

During the Pre-reading Phase, what two main questions should you answer? ? Part 1: "What is the book about?" Part 2: "How is the book divided?"

What are the three key pieces of information to identify in Analytical Reading?
?
1. Argument (central idea - first level)
2. Conclusion (explanations/divisions of argument - second level)
3. Evidence (supporting data - third level)
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,229-->

What does the PACER acronym stand for in information categorization?::P-Procedural, A-Analogous, C-Conceptual, E-Evidence, R-Reference
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210-->

==Procedural information== teaches you how something should be executed, and its targeted digestion process is ==practice== - applying the information in real life as early as possible.
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,236!2025-10-01,1,221-->

What is the targeted digestion process for Analogous information?
?
Critique the analogy by examining:
- How are these things similar/related?
- How are they different?
- When doesn't this analogy make sense?
- Is there a better analogy?
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,216-->

What is the key digestion process for Conceptual information?::Mapping using non-linear, network-based note-taking methods like mind mapping to show interconnections
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,229-->

Evidence vs Reference information
?
- Evidence makes conceptual information more concrete (detailed facts, statistics, cases)
- Reference is specific detailed information that doesn't change conceptual understanding (constants, names, lists)
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,235-->

What percentage of consumed information can be forgotten without proper digestion?::Up to 90% of consumed information despite hours of consumption
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,230-->

What is the forgetting curve timeline discovered by Ebbinghaus?
?
- 50% of new information forgotten within 1 hour
- 70% forgotten within 24 hours
- 90% forgotten within 1 week without intervention
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,229-->

What are the key habits of highly effective students regarding study scheduling?
?
- Schedule specific study time (clears distractions)
- Study 3-4 hours per day broken into 2-3 separate sessions
- Maintain consistency at least 5 days per week
- Study alone with distractions eliminated
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,229-->

==Teaching peers== is a crucial habit for mastery, following the concept of "==watch one, do one, teach one==" which helps test and develop proficiency.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210!2025-10-02,2,230-->

What type of motivation do the most successful students cultivate?::Long-term aspirational motivation with broad, abstract understanding of how academic success impacts their lives and families
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,214-->

What are David Perell's key notebook characteristics for effective note-taking?
?
- Spiral notebook (lies flat, pages can be ripped out)
- Hard front and back for durability
- Pocket-sized for portability
- Quality paper that feels good to write on
- Disposable nature (rips out pages frequently)
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,219-->

==Encoding and retrieval== are ==two sides of the same coin== — you cannot retrieve what you don’t encode effectively.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210!2025-10-01,1,215-->

Effective encoding flattens the ==forgetting curve==, reducing the need for ==frequent revisions==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,216!2025-10-01,1,214-->

==Desirable difficulty== means encoding feels ==confusing and effortful==, but that effort ==strengthens retention==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,214!2025-10-02,2,230!2025-10-01,1,229-->

Dr. Justin Sung critiques SR because it is ==repetitive with diminishing returns==, while ==encoding quality== reduces review needs.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,206!2025-10-01,1,221-->

The forgetting curve without review: ==50% forgotten in 1 hour==, ==70% in 24 hours==, ==90% in 1 week==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,236!2025-10-02,2,234!2025-10-01,1,206-->

University of Leicester (2020): Students using SR scored ==70%== vs ==64%== with cramming.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210!2025-10-01,1,206-->

PACER stands for ==Procedural, Analogous, Conceptual, Evidence, Reference==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,219-->

Procedural digestion = ==practice immediately in real life==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,229-->

Analogous digestion = ==critique the analogy== (similarities, differences, limits, extensions).
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,238-->

Conceptual digestion = ==mapping connections== (mind maps, non-linear notes).
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,214-->

Evidence digestion = ==store + rehearse== (integrate into systems, then apply).
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,206-->

Reference digestion = ==store + rehearse with direct recall== (ideal for flashcards).
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210-->

Highly effective students study ==3–4 hours per day==, broken into ==2–3 sessions==, at least ==5 days per week==.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,206!2025-10-01,1,221!2025-10-03,3,269-->

==Teaching peers== follows the principle “==watch one, do one, teach one==” to consolidate mastery.
<!--SR:!2025-10-02,2,230!2025-10-02,2,230-->

Motivation of top students: ==long-term aspirational goals== pulling them through effort and fatigue.
<!--SR:!2025-10-01,1,210-->
